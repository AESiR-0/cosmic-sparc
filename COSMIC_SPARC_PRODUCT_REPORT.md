## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- [~] Role-based route protection: dashboard uses role checks, but not all routes are strictly enforced; `/dashboard` is accessible to both admin and ticketeer (should be admin-only for most routes)
- [~] Event edit page: exists, but may lack robust date formatting and validation
- [~] Tickets, Users, Settings pages: UI stubs only; no real data or actions implemented
- [~] Custom registration form: FormRenderer exists, but no event-specific JSON schema builder, preview, or DB save/load logic
- [~] Loading/error states: present in some places, but not consistent across all forms and pages
- [~] Mobile UX: layout is responsive, but some admin pages may need further mobile polish
- [~] Organizer dashboard: no analytics, no staff assignment UI, no export for check-ins/analytics, no payment status monitoring
- [~] Admin can view all users/events, but cannot yet assign roles, reset access, or impersonate
- [~] No real payment reports or Razorpay dashboard integration
- [~] No platform settings (themes, commissions, integrations) UI

## ‚õî Missing
- [ ] Public homepage feed for event discovery
- [ ] `/events/[slug]` public event page (event info, dynamic registration form)
- [ ] Registration form submission: save to `registrations` table
- [ ] Ticket/QR code generation on registration
- [ ] Registration confirmation page (ticket info, QR code)
- [ ] Email ticket confirmation logic (SMTP2GO or similar)
- [ ] WhatsApp notification stub
- [ ] Razorpay payment integration (public user flow)
- [ ] QR scanner for ticketeer (`/scanner` route, QR code reader, registration verification logic)
- [ ] Role-based export/CSV download (admin/organizer)
- [ ] Event assignment for ticketeers (admin/organizer)
- [ ] Dynamic form schema save/load per event
- [ ] Row-level security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [ ] Admin: manage staff, payouts, analytics, platform settings, impersonate users, support creators
- [ ] Organizer: monitor payment status (paid/unpaid), assign staff, export data for check-ins/analytics, analytics dashboard
- [ ] Ticketeer: see only assigned events, view attendee list (readonly), sync real-time with server, audit logs for check-ins
- [ ] Audit logs for admin/ticketeer actions (e.g., check-ins, user changes)

## üîí Security Gaps
- [ ] RLS not enforced in Supabase (no SQL policies or migration scripts for RLS on `users`, `events`, or `registrations`)
- [ ] Route protection: `/dashboard/` and subroutes are only protected client-side; no server-side or API-level enforcement
- [ ] Ticketeer/public role gating: no `/scanner` route for ticketeer; public users can potentially access restricted pages if they bypass the UI
- [ ] API data access: no server-side checks to prevent public users from accessing admin/ticketeer data via API calls
- [ ] No audit logs for check-ins or admin/ticketeer actions
